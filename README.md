## Introduction

Welcome to the **NYC Yellow Taxi Insights with Data Science** project repository! This project aims to explore and analyze the vast dataset provided by the New York City Yellow Taxi service. Leveraging data science techniques and tools, we dive into the intricacies of taxi rides, seeking meaningful insights into urban transportation patterns.

**Key Features:**
- Data Acquisition: Downloaded raw data from the official New York Yellow Taxi website.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Utilized Pandas in Jupyter Notebook to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Data Modeling: Created an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to guide the structuring of data into meaningful segments.
- Database Management: Established a MySQL database, 'nycyellowline,' and uploaded segmented data tables using DBeaver.
- Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory analysis using SQL in DBeaver, extracting valuable insights from the relational database.
- Data Visualization: Translated findings into visualizations using Tableau, providing a comprehensive view of the dataset.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook)
- MySQL (DBeaver)
